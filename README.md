# Coin toss analysis

## In random sampling of a population, there is usually a threshold in which higher numbers do not significantly affect the overall outcome of the analysis. Some studies say that above the 1000 data set threshold, there isn't a significant difference in the outcome.

## In other words, a random representative sampling of 1000 units of a population is sufficient to determine the characteristics of the whole population irrespective of the total number of the population.

## This repository attempts to test this assumption by simulation a coin toss involving only two outcomes (Head and Tail) and then plots a bar chart showing the percentage outcome at different stages of the coin toss to determine if there is any significant changes above the 1000 coin toss threshold.
